## Overview
CCTV_SENTRY_YOLO11 is an advanced object detection system built using YOLOv11 by Ultralytics. It provides real-time monitoring, object tracking, and line-crossing detection for IP camera streams. Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, it enables users to easily interact with the model via a web interface.

## Features
- **Line-Crossing Detection**: Detects objects crossing user-defined lines.
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv11 for high-speed object tracking.
- **Interactive Interface**: Powered by Gradio for an intuitive user experience.
- **Customizable Classes**: Filter objects based on specific detection classes.
- **Detailed Visualization**: Annotated frames with bounding boxes, IDs, and counts.

## Model Details
The system leverages the YOLOv11 model from Ultralytics for accurate and efficient object detection. Key technologies include:
- **OpenCV**: For video frame processing.
- **Gradio**: For creating an interactive user interface.
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: For state-of-the-art object detection and tracking.

## How It Works
1. Upload or provide the URL of an IP camera stream.
2. Draw a line on the first frame to set the detection boundary.
3. Select the object classes to monitor.
4. Watch real-time detections and line-crossing counts directly on the interface.
